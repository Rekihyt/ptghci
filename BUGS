- Sometimes, a keyboard interrupt interrupts the python program but not GHCi; this can result in a frozen program because Haskell doesn't sent a response (as it would if GHCi was successully interrupted), and so the Python-side socket will keep waiting for a response from GHCi that never comes.  Sometimes in vanilla GHCi it takes two Ctrl-C to interrupt successfully, for some reason.
    ==> This appears to be a limitation with ghcid, which will not 
- When there is more than one error, the second one seems to get printed out after the next input prompt
 (more generally -- do I always show the prompt immediately when there's some kind of long-running program??)
- Calculating anchors for data constructors  (??)
- Anchor source/doc lookups on operators
- Preservation of 'it'
- "+t" behavior


FIXED
- Completion: immediately go to first match
- Stdout with rerun (output should come AFTER ==Output== label)
- Fail gracefully on exception rather than exiting
- Weird errors when evaluting a statement that isn't showable (INTERNAL_GHCID)
- History from %hist is not lined up with displayed line no
- Quitting gracefully
- Deleting newline with backspace (sometimes)
- Docs not opening to correct anchor (solution: use browser by name instead of xdg-open)
- Open source/doc on qualified name
