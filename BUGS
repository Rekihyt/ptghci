- Do notation with "where"
- Fail gracefully on exception rather than exiting
- Calculating anchors for data constructors  (??)
- Weird errors when evaluting a statement that isn't showable (INTERNAL_GHCID)
- Do source/doc lookups work on operators?
- Open source/doc on qualified name
- Stdout with rerun (output should come AFTER ==Output== label)

FIXED
- History from %hist is not lined up with displayed line no
- Quitting gracefully
- Deleting newline with backspace (sometimes)
- Docs not opening to correct anchor (solution: use browser by name instead of xdg-open)
